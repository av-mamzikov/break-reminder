# Break Reminder

A lightweight application that displays reminder notifications prompting users to take regular breaks from their computer screen. It creates a popup window that reminds users to stand up, stretch, and rest their eyes from screen time, helping to prevent eye strain and physical discomfort associated with prolonged computer use.

âœ¨ **Now with multi-language support!** The application automatically detects your system language and displays messages accordingly.
